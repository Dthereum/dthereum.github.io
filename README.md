# Ethereum Deliverance
True Decentralization for the Ethereum blockchain. Owned and controlled by nobody.

## All your DAPPs are belong to Them
Building on the Ethereum main chain is a dangerous risk for your DAPP. Currently the Ethereum foundation has complete control of the platform, and can kill your DAPP any time they want. Dthereum is a safe platform for DAPP developers because nobody will ever have a controlling interest in the currency.

### Massive Pre-mine
60 million Ether were pre-mined, and only 20 million were mined since. Most of those coins are held by a small group that controls the foundation. Even the mining in the early days was mostly controlled by the foundation and paid for by the crowdsale proceeds.

### Small fraction of coins in circulation
Most of the coins that are sold are the ones that were mined in the last year, simply because miners need to pay for their equipment and electricity. Every time you raise money for an ICO, it pushes the price much higher and the benefit mostly goes to the foundation.

### Consensys is your competition
Would you want to compete with the government? Consensys controls the foundation, and can copy your DAPP and destroy you with their control of the network and manipulation of the currency. No matter how much you raise, you will never beat them.

### Proof-of-stake gives them total control
Ethereum is planning to fork to a Proof-of-Stake model that gives the foundation total control of what transactions they will allow on the network. In addition, it gives them all of the remaining coins, further increasing their control.

### Difficulty bomb guarantees PoS fork
Even if the miners do not fork to Proof-of-Stake, Ethereum has a built-in mechanism to force miners over to the Proof-of-Stake fork, or else the entire network will fail.

### Legitimate miners face huge losses
The huge amount of hash power on Ethereum will not be able to mine Ethereum anymore, and will have to move to other coins, but the massive increase in power on those networks will make it unprofitable. Huge investments in mining equipment will be lost.

## The importance of miners
Before bitcoin, there were many cryptocurrencies, many consensus mechanisms, and all of them failed for a simple reason. There was no mechanism for open participation and distribution of the currency. Mining as a cash flow business is the best mechanism we have to distribute the currency and allow open participation. The vast majority of economic transactions on bitcoin has always been for electricity and mining equipment. This was the true genius of Satoshi. 

## Deliverance
We will fix these problems with Ethereum with a simple fork and a new chain

### All coins will be mined
There will be no pre-sale, no pre-mine.

### No reduction in reward
Miners will continue to be profitable for as long as the currency is in use.

### No Proof-of-Stake
The currency will always be controlled by miners. 

### 100% compatible
This fork will be 100% compatible with all existing ethereum smart contracts, ready for deployment immediately.

## Nothing to Gain!
I am not a miner; I have one GPU that I use for deep learning research. I did make a fairly large investment into ETH years ago, but I'm okay with losing it. Why am I doing this? I've been interested in this field since I first saw David Chaum on NOVA in 1992. I read Satoshi's paper in 2008. I want cryptocurrency to create a better world, not something with bigger problems than we already have with fiat.

## Economic Darwinism
In the long run, the currency that supports the strongest economy will win. Generally this means getting as many people to contribute their time and creativity to productive purposes as possible. 

### Open and Trustless
Trust is inefficient. Any controlling interest in a currency requires trust and creates uncertainty. It's not enough to consider yourself trustworthy and promise you won't do anything wrong. 

### Economic distribution
An efficient economy distributes capital according to an individual's contribution. Mining provides the bedrock of a long chain of economic activity that is the best mechanism for economically-efficient distribution we know of. There have been other experiments with airdrops and human busy-work, but actually mining has much more efficient downstream distribution effects to get currency in the hands of those deploying capital to productive purposes. We're still researching our "proof of interstellar-colonization" blockchain.

### Clean history
The history of cryptocurrency is littered with scams, hacks, and law enforcement activity. We've learned a lot since then. It's still early, but we should do our best to avoid inheriting the bad effects from these failures when the systems are not robust to them.

### Sense of Fairness
Fairness, whether you like it or not, is a huge emotional driver for human activity. The feeling of "unfairness" makes people disengage, revolt, and go to war. It's a huge source of productive drain on an economy. The last human economic system will be considered "fair" by the largest number of productive and creative people. I can only guess whether the robots will care.
